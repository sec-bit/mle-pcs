We'll be working with a **finite field**, which you can think of as a set of numbers where addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division are all well-defined.

    "An **irreducible polynomial** is a polynomial that cannot be factored into two non-constant polynomials of smaller degree.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, over $\\mathbb{F}_2$, the polynomial $X^2 + X + 1$ is irreducible because its only possible factors are $X$ and $X + 1$, and neither divides it. However, $X^2 + 1$ is reducible over $\\mathbb{F}_2$ since $X^2 + 1 = (X + 1)(X + 1)$.\n",
    "\n",

We can use it to construct the field $\\mathbb{F}_{7^2}$, which has $7^2 = 49$ elements. The elements are all linear polynomials of the form $aX + b$ where $a, b \\in \\mathbb{F}_7$.\n",

    "### Finding an Irreducible Polynomial\n",
    "\n",
    "To construct these fields, we need a reliable way to find an irreducible polynomial of a given degree $s$. While there are deterministic ways, a simple and effective method is a **randomized algorithm**:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Generate a random **monic** polynomial $F(X)$ of degree $s$ with coefficients in $\\mathbb{F}_q$.\n",
    "2. Test if $F(X)$ is irreducible.\n",
    "3. If it is, you're done! If not, go back to step 1.\n",
    "\n",
    "The key is the test in step 2. A polynomial $F(X)$ of degree $s$ is irreducible over $\\mathbb{F}_q$ **iff** it satisfies two conditions:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. $F(X)$ divides $X^{q^{\\,s}} - X$.\n",
    "2. For every prime factor $d$ of $s$, the greatest common divisor\n",
    "   $\\gcd\\!\\big(F(X),\\, X^{q^{\\,s/d}} - X\\big)$ is $1$.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Condition 1: $F(X)$ must divide $X^{q^{s}} - X$\n",
    "\n",
    "This is the **\"Belonging\" Test**. The polynomial $X^{q^{s}} - X$ is very special: its roots are **all the elements** of the field $\\mathbb{F}_{q^s}$. If $F(X)$ is genuinely an irreducible polynomial of degree $s$, its roots must live in $\\mathbb{F}_{q^s}$. Therefore, $F(X)$ must be a factor of the polynomial that defines the entire field. This check confirms that $F(X)$’s roots are in the correct target field.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Condition 2: $\\gcd(F(X),\\, X^{q^{\\,s/d}} - X) = 1$\n",
    "\n",
    "This is the **\"Minimality\" Test**. The field $\\mathbb{F}_{q^s}$ contains smaller subfields, like $\\mathbb{F}_{q^{s/d}}$, for every prime factor $d$ of $s$. If the $\\gcd$ in this test is not $1$, it means $F(X)$ shares roots with a polynomial that defines a smaller subfield. This would imply $F(X)$ is reducible, with factors belonging to that smaller field. An irreducible polynomial of degree $s$ must be “native” to $\\mathbb{F}_{q^s}$, so this test ensures its roots aren’t secretly from a smaller subfield.\n",
    "\n",
    "**In essence:** Condition 1 checks that the roots are in the **right field**, while Condition 2 checks they aren’t in any **smaller field**. Together, they prove that $F(X)$ must be irreducible of degree $s$.\n",
