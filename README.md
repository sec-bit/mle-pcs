## Background

Multilinear Polynomial Commitment Schemes (MLE PCS) are fundamental building blocks in the field of cryptography, particularly within zero-knowledge proofs. These schemes enable the commitment to a multilinear polynomial in such a way that the prover can later reveal evaluations of the polynomial at specific points without revealing the entire polynomial. Efficient and secure MLE PCS schemes are crucial for the development of scalable and practical zero-knowledge proof systems.

This repository, **mle-pcs**, is a research-driven project focused on the Comparison of Multilinear Polynomial Commitment Schemes. The research is supported by the Ethereum Foundation and aims to provide a comprehensive analysis of different schemes, their design philosophies, security properties, and performance metrics.

## Project Purpose

The primary objective of this project is to conduct a comprehensive comparison of various MLE PCS schemes. By implementing reference codes and analyzing their protocol designs, security parameters, and performance metrics, we aim to identify the strengths and weaknesses of each scheme.

## Features

- **Reference Implementations**: Python-based implementations of various MLE PCS schemes to deepen understanding.
- **Interactive Tutorials**: Jupyter notebooks serve as interactive playgrounds for experimenting with different schemes.
- **Comprehensive Notes**: Detailed research notes available in each folder, provided in both English and Chinese.
- **Future Blog Posts**: Planned blog posts will elaborate on the research findings and comparisons.

## Project Structure

The repository is organized to facilitate both research and experimental exploration:
